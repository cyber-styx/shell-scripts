# shell-scripts
So I never have to write this one infuriating shell script again. 

The only thing in here at the moment is "simpler-media-status," and
it' s just a script to output the artist & song title of whatever
music is playing / the phrase "paused" if paused / "shhh.." if nothing
is playing.

Works with Youtube music on Firefox, and in theory should work with
any media picked up by playerctl/mpris-ctl. 

Use at your own risk!! (I mean it should be fine but I don't know
what I don't know).

Fair warning I'm not a programmer/coder/etc, just a Linux user 
who wanted to write a shell script and save it in case my system
dies one day.
